## Introduction
Hi! My name is Julia, I am a senior at Lehigh University majoring in English with two minors in Journalism and Biology. 
My [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jules.reads.books?igsh=MTl1MnNha2tmeTI3MQ%3D%3D&utm_source=qr) where I talk about all things book, literature, and reading

## Lehigh University Enrollment by College
With data from [The Office of Institutional Data](https://data.lehigh.edu/sites/data.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2024.pdf) I created this pie chart which shows enrollment in Lehigh University by college, with percents for each. This graphic was created on Canva.

## Bethelehem Residents Ethnicity
With data from the [US Census](https://data.census.gov/profile/Bethlehem_city,_Pennsylvania?g=160XX00US4206088#race-and-ethnicity) I created this graphic on Canva which shows the number of Bethlehem residents by race. Most of the residents in Bethlehem are White, followed by Hispanic or Latino. Immigration, race, and ethinicity has been a hot button topic in Bethlehem as new immigration policies roll out. This graphic shows that many Bethlehem residents either immigrated or had an ancestor who immigrated to the US from a Hispanic or Latino place of origin.
